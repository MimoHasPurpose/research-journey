# quaterions:

rotations are 3d transformations

but they are linear transn

can be expressed using 3*3 matrix

euler rotation?

Combining two rotations represented with matrices is dead easy: it is just matrix multiplication

So, matrices use too much space, and are hard to reason about, but compose nicely. Euler angles save up on space, but are worse in pretty much any other way

At least until [Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton) figured out that you need not two, but _three_ imaginary units. Then everything just works, and you get a really cool and immensely important mathematical object. You do lose one thing, though: multiplication is no longer _commutative_, i.e. it isn't always true that a⋅b=b⋅a. _Later it was_ [_proved by Frobenius_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frobenius_theorem_\(real_division_algebras\)) _that, indeed, there isn't an analogue with two imaginary units, or any other number of them._

It also turned out that the very same mathematical object solves the previous problem of representing rotations! Is it a coincidence

_That there is some nice algebra that is able to represent 3D rotations follows directly from the general framework of Clifford algebras, and imaginary units arise quite naturally there. However, nothing forces every non-zero element of this algebra to be invertible, and in fact this isn't true for_ [_split-biquaternions_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-biquaternion)_, the analogue used for 4D rotations. That regular quaternions are so nice seems to be a special feature that only exists in low (<4) dimensions._

The set of quaternions is usually denoted as H, in honour of Rowan Hamilton

Now, there are many equivalent ways to _define_ quaternions:

- A 4-dimensional algebra with a certain multiplication law
    
- An algebra defined by certain multiplication rules
    
- The unique noncommutative real finite-dimensional [division algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algebra)
    
- The [even subalgebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra#Grading) of the [Clifford algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra) of the 3D space Cl0(R3)
    
- The algebra generated by 3D [bivectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivector)
    
- The algebra generated by 3D [rotors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotor_\(mathematics\))
    

Probably the simplest way to put this is to say that quaternions are just **4-dimensional vectors** with real coordinates, together with some **special multiplication** rule. So, quaternions are 4-tuples of real numbers (a,b,c,d), which we can add and subtract component-wise

(a,b,c,d)±(w,x,y,z)=(a±w,b±x,c±y,d±z)and also a multiplication of such tuples is defined:

(a,b,c,d)⋅(w,x,y,z)=(e,f,g,h)

where (e,f,g,h) somehow depend on (a,b,c,d) and (w,x,y,z). We'll discuss the exact multiplication rule in just a minute. What is important is that it isn't commutative – in general, the result of multiplication depends on the order of the operands:

p⋅q≠q⋅p

That is, given a quaternion (a,b,c,d) and a real number k, we can form the scalar-vector product

k⋅(a,b,c,d)=(ka,kb,kc,kd)
