category level methods and instance level methods both had limitations so came a new approach (category agnostic approach).

they are further divided into model based methods (require textured rgb 3d cad models at test time) and model free methods( multiview reference images or video sequences of target objects during inference)
## model:
model free approach
- pose estimation via a single achor rgb-d image.
- 

## dataset:
REAL275, ToyotaLight, HO3D, YCBINEOAT, and LM-O
