## Important notes below:

## World coordinate system
 Its major functions are:  
(1) Defining the 3D coordinates of objects;  
(2) Determining the position of calibration objects based on the origin during calibration;  
(3) Providing the position of the camera coordinate system relative to the world coordinate system, thereby determining the coordinate relationship between two or more cameras.
