- AIXI model of superintelligence
- HL(Lambda) algorithm
- AIXI(tl) algorithm
- Fitness uniform optimization
- Godel machine
- The path to superintelligence is via building machines capable of running faster than humans, but what is
  superintellience? how is it different from ours? is intelligence the center of humans definition?

- Is building intelligent machines a good idea?
- Unified view of AI: decision theory(probability +utility theory)+universal induction(ockham+bayes+turing)
  occam's razor: take simplest hypothesis consistent with data.
  solomonoff induction: correctly predict sequence with absolue minimum amount of data.

- solomonoff-induction: recipe for finding truth.
- algorithms: are always clear
#### Scientific method:
- make observation
- form a hypothesis
- conduct experiment
- if experimental results disconfirm hypothesis return to step 2, form a new hypothesis.
