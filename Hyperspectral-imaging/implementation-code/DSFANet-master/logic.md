## method
- first we take X, Y, GT and calculate diff from utils.cva by X, Y
- CVAdiff.png: shape is 463,241, cmap ="gray"
- calling main function(X,Y,GT,diff)
- main():
    - train_num=2000, max_iters=100
    - lr=13-3
    - index
    - XData, YData
    - training:
    - 100 iters
    - loss calculated
    - grads
    - optimizer
